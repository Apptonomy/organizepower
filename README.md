## Motivation
People across the United States are participating in active democracy at unprecedented levels, generously donating their money, time, and energy to protesting existing power structures and building a better world. But systemic and structural forces are difficult to overcome. The fight for justice requires sustained organizing, coordination, and momentum.

Our app, Organize Power, helps bridge the gap between the desire for change and impactful action. We encourage users to engage directly with the movements they are inspired by and start their own movements. We give organizers the tools to encourage their followers to pressure public figures, attend events, and donate money to grassroots causes.

1. Confirm working tree is clean and on local master branch.
git status
git checkout master

2. Ensure your local master is in-sync with org master.
git pull upstream master

3. Create a new branch.
git checkout -b new-branch-name

4. Check status to confirm you are on new branch.
git status

5. Make edits. Stage changes. Make commits with imperative message.

6. Check for updates to org master and merge into your new branch.
git pull upstream master

7. After incorporating new changes
git push origin new-branch-name

8. Go to GitHub and submit a pull request from your origin.

9. Someone should review your code and either merge or request revisions.

10a. If no revisions are necessary, merge pull request on GitHub.
10b. If revisions are necessary, return to step 5.

11. After merging, checkout local master branch and delete the branch. Also, delete the branch on GitHub org master.
git checkout master
git branch -d new-branch-name

12. Update local master and origin master.
git pull upstream master
git push origin master

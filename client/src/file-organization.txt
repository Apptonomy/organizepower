/src
  /assets
  /components
  /contexts
  /lib
  /pages
  /services
  /styles
  AppRoutes.tsx
  index.tsx

Here's a quick overview of what are in these folders.

/assets - images, logos.
/components - components that are shared between multiple pages.
/contexts - I keep all of the context components in a separate folder, to not confuse them with plain old react components. A common context I like to implement is UserAuthContext.tsx.
/lib - When using a 3rd party library, let's say like Firebase for example, I like to put all of the initialization in a folder called lib. I'll then export the instance of that initialized library.
/pages - Pages are also react components, but they represent a page or screen of an app. These map 1:1 with a route in the AppRoutes.tsx file.
/services - All of my api methods are put in a folder called services. I like to do this so that I don't put the business logic of an API call directly into a component, and so that any component can easily reference a service that it needs.
/styles - I very rarely write custom css, instead opting to use a framework like tailwindcss. This styles folder is where my generated styles and any custom css goes.

AppRoutes - This file contains all the routes of my application. I've been using react-router for a while, and I like to have one file that contains all my routes so that I can see it all at a glance.
index.tsx - This is your typical index file, where you render your React app to the document.
